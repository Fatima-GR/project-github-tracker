# GitHub Tracker

The assignment was to create a place to keep track of the GitHub repos that I use at Technigo. The focus was JavaScript and API.

Also it was very interesting using the open-source `Chart.js` to create the chart about how many projects we finished and how many projects left at the Technigo course. (See `https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/`)

## The problem

In the beginning of the project it felt like there were a lot of API fetches that needed to be done. It was also hard to understand were to place, and where to call the different functions. 
The solution were to scale down the project and do small chunks at a time.
